This started as a project for a Python udemy course to send an email when the ISS was overhead at night

After completing the project, I realized the email was being sent too close to the time of the flyover,
so you do not have time to actually see the station fly over.

Going back to the api documentation I found out that I could request future estimated flyovers by changing
the request to the Lat/Lng of the user location vs asking for the current location of the station.

The API returns the risetime(utc) and duration(seconds) any time the ISS is estimated to be within
 +- 10 degrees of input lat/lng
